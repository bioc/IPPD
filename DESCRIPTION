Description: The package provides functionality to extract isotopic peak
  patterns from raw mass spectra. This is done by fitting a large set of
  template basis functions to the raw spectrum using either nonnegative least
  squares or least absolute deviation fittting. The
  package offers a flexible function which
  tries to estimate model parameters in a way tailored to the peak shapes in the data.
